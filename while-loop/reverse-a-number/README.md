# Reverse Number Program

## Question

**What does this program do?**

This C program calculates the reverse of a user-entered number using a while loop.

## Explanation

The program includes:

1. **Reverse Number Function:**
   - The `reverseNumber` function takes an integer `n` as input and calculates its reverse using a `while` loop.
   - It initializes a variable `rev` to 0 and iteratively appends the last digit of `n` to `rev` while removing that digit from `n`.

2. **Main Function:**
   - In the `main` function, the user is prompted to enter a desired number using `printf` and `scanf`.
   - The `reverseNumber` function is then called with the user-entered number, and the result is printed to the console using `printf`.

3. **Output:**
   - The program displays the reverse of the user-entered number.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the source code file.
2. Compile the code using a C compiler (e.g., gcc).
3. Run the executable.
4. Enter a number when prompted.
5. Observe the program's output, which will be the reverse of the entered number.

Feel free to experiment with different input values and observe the program's behavior.
