# Fibonacci Sequence Printer

## Question

**What does this program do?**

This C program prints the first n terms of the Fibonacci sequence using a for loop.

## Explanation

The program includes:

1. **Fibonacci Printer Function (`printFibonacci`):**
   - Takes an integer `n` as input and prints the first n terms of the Fibonacci sequence.
   - Uses a for loop to iteratively calculate and print each term.

2. **Main Function:**
   - Gets user input for the number of terms.
   - Checks for non-negative input.
   - Calls the `printFibonacci` function to display the Fibonacci sequence.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the source code file.
2. Compile the code using a C compiler (e.g., gcc).
3. Run the executable.
4. Enter a positive number when prompted for the number of terms.
5. Observe the program's output, which will be the first n terms of the Fibonacci sequence.

Feel free to experiment with different values for n and observe how the program generates the Fibonacci sequence.
