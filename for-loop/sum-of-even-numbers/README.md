# Even Number Sum Program

## Question

**What does this program do?**

This C program calculates the sum of all even numbers from 1 to a user-entered number.

## Explanation

The program includes:

1. **Even Sum Function:**
   - The `evenSum` function takes an integer `n` as input and calculates the sum of all even numbers from 1 to `n` using a `for` loop and an `if` statement.

2. **Main Function:**
   - In the `main` function, the user is prompted to enter a desired number using `printf` and `scanf`.
   - The `evenSum` function is then called with the user-entered number, and the result is printed to the console using `printf`.

3. **Output:**
   - The program displays the sum of even numbers from 1 to the user-entered number.
