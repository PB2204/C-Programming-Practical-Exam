# Number Print Program

## Question

**What does this program do?**

This C program prompts the user to enter a number and then prints the numbers from 1 to the entered number in ascending order, each on a new line.

## Explanation

The program follows these steps:

1. **User Input:**
   - Asks the user to enter a number using the `printf` and `scanf` functions.

2. **For Loop:**
   - Utilizes a `for` loop to iterate from 1 to the entered number (`num`).
   - Inside the loop, it prints the current value of the loop variable (`i`) followed by a newline using the `printf` function.

3. **Output:**
   - Displays the numbers from 1 to the entered number on the console.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the source code file.
2. Compile the code using a C compiler (e.g., gcc).
3. Run the executable.
4. Enter a number when prompted.
5. Observe the program's output, which will be a list of numbers from 1 to the entered number.

Feel free to experiment with different input values and observe the program's behavior.
